Hi!  
So. I'm gonna make a game. Why?  

**YOU KNOW WHY**  
(long pause)  

so! We have a few criteria for our game. It has to be:
- An adaptation of an older (procedurally written) game
- Written according to the Object Oriented Paradigm
- Extensively documented (show picture of documentation / graph requirements)
- **FUN** (Massive echo)
